# Deploying a Lambda function on Kubernetes: 
How you can containerize your Lambda code and deploy it on Kubernetes:

  Step 1: Containerize Lambda Code
  First, you need to containerize your Lambda code and dependencies. Create a Dockerfile that includes your Lambda code and sets up the required environment.
  (Dockerfile)


  Step 2: Build the Docker Image
  Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and tag it with a suitable name and version

  $ docker build -t your-lambda-image:latest .


  Step 3: Push the Docker Image to a Container Registry
  Push the built Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, or any other registry of your choice

  $ docker push your-lambda-image:latest


  Step 4: Deploy on Kubernetes
  Now, you can deploy the Docker image to Kubernetes using a deployment manifest. Assuming you have Kubernetes properly set up, create a Kubernetes deployment YAML      file (lambda_deployment.yaml)


  Step 5: Access Your Lambda Code on Kubernetes
  With the deployment running, you can now access your Lambda code within the container running on Kubernetes. Depending on your use case, you might expose the          service externally using Kubernetes services or use it internally within your cluster.

  $ kubectl apply -f lambda_deployment.yaml
